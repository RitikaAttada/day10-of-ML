## 🌱 Day 10 of My Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to Day 10 of my ML journey!
Today I worked on **linear regression** using real-world datasets from **Kaggle** and trained multiple TensorFlow models inside **Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code**. I created modular functions that handle normalization, training, prediction, and visualization — making it easier to reuse and scale.

### 📊 Simple Linear Regression Projects

1. 💼 **Predict Salary from Experience**

   * **Source:** Kaggle
   * Inputs: Years of experience
   * Output: Salary in ₹
   * Insight: Linear upward trend in salary with experience

2. 🧾 **Predict Insurance Premium from Age**

   * **Source:** Self-curated
   * Inputs: Age
   * Output: Insurance premium in ₹
   * Observation: Premium increases consistently with age

3. 🧠 **Predict Exam Scores from Study Hours**

   * **Source:** Kaggle (Student Scores dataset)
   * Inputs: Hours studied
   * Output: Exam score (%)
   * Result: Model captured the positive correlation cleanly
